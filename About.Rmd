# About This App

This app is designed to explore and predict student dropout and academic success. It aims to help educators and administrators identify students at risk and improve overall academic outcomes.

## Why did I choose this dataset?

It contains a rich set of student-level academic and demographic features, including:

-   Grades from previous periods
-   Attendance and absences
-   Study habits and extracurricular activities
-   Family background and support information
-   Other Predictors (check App page)

These features allow for a **comprehensive analysis of factors influencing academic performance and dropout risk**, making it ideal for both predictive modeling and exploratory analysis.

## Why did I choose regression and classification Algorithms?

This project uses **both regression and classification algorithms** because the dataset allows for two complementary goals:

1.  **Regression**: Predicting the final numeric grade of a student.
    -   Algorithms used: **Random Forest Regression**, **Gradient Boosting Regression**, and **Lasso regression**.\
    -   Reason: They can handle both numeric and categorical variables, capture non-linear relationships, and provide feature importance insights.
2.  **Classification**: Predicting whether a student will **pass/fail** or **drop out**.
    -   Algorithms used: **Random Forest Classifier** and **Decision Tree Classifier**.\
    -   Reason: They effectively detect complex interactions between features, handle mixed data types, and offer interpretable risk factors for educators.

By using both approaches, the app can provide **detailed numeric predictions** as well as **actionable risk classifications**.

## What kind of problems this app can solve?

This app can help schools and universities:

-   Identify students at **risk of failing or dropping out** early.
-   Understand **key factors influencing academic success**.
-   Allocate **resources and interventions** effectively.
-   Track overall **student performance trends** for strategic planning.

## What is my data?

The dataset comes from the [**UCI Student Performance Dataset**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success). It contains:

-   Student demographics (age, gender, parental education, etc.)
-   Academic scores and grades
-   Attendance and study habits
-   Other factors that may impact performance (check link for more details)

This variety of features enables both regression and classification models to produce meaningful predictions.

## How did I do my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

Before building models, I performed a thorough EDA to understand the structure, quality, and relationships in the data:

-   Installed and loaded essential R libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
-   Imported the student dataset and **examined its structure**, **summary statistics**, and **missing values**.
-   Cleaned the data by **converting categorical variables to factors** and **removing incomplete records**.
-   Analyzed single variables (Univariate analysis) through histograms and bar charts.
-   Compared variables with the target outcome using boxplots and stacked bar plots.
-   Created new meaningful features such as unit completion ratio and age group segmentation.
-   Explored how these engineered features relate to academic performance and dropout trends.
